How to install BOINC without administrative rights on Windows?

Download the installation archive and save it to some temporary location. Start command prompt ( Start->Run -> type "cmd" -> enter ) and change directory to the location where you saved the installation archive. Run the installation from the command line with /a flag. For example, run "boinc_5.8.15_windows_intelx86.exe /a". This will first prompt for the directory where you want to extract your installation files. You can select the same location as you chose previously to save the installation archive. Next you will be prompted to enter the installation directory. This can be any directory where you have access to. In the end of the installation you will be prompted to launch BOINC. If you do, you will then be able to connect to the project as described in detail here. Please note, that in order for BOINC to start every time you log in, you have to put a shortcut to BOINC manager "boincmgr.exe", found in your installation directory, into the "Startup" folder. Note, that BOINC must run on your computer in order to perform computations. To create this shortcut, go to the installation directory using Windows file browser, right-click on boincmgr.exe and select "Create shortcut". The shortcut will be created in the same directory and will appear in the bottom of the file list. Select the shortcut, right-click -> cut. Then open the "Startup" folder ( Start->Programs->Startup, right-click -> Explore ). This will open the file browser. Now right-click on any empty space in the right part of the browser window and select "Paste". You are done. If you have not started BOINC already, you can do it by invoking boincmgr.exe.
